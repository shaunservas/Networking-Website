Parental controls are easy to access nowadays, and most wireless routers come in with it built-in. to check if your router has parental controls, you can check the user manual, or type in your personal ip address (to find out your ip address search in google what is my ip address and it will show you) into the search bar of your browser, which will direct you to the browsers menu, log into this using your username and password for the router and search for parental controls, if there is then follow the prompts to configure it to your liking, but if not then will be slightly more tricky.

Open DNS is a website that gives home internet security. They have three different types: Family shield, Home and premium. Family shield is free and is pre-configured to block adult content. Home allows custom filtering to stop access to unwanted content. Premium does all of the home but also holds annual internet stats of the home network and can restrict internet access to white-listed domains, meaning you can block websites that isnt really adult content but you still dont want your child to see it. To access openDNS, go to this url : https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/, pick the option wanted, and follow the prompts.

Cyber security is a big thing nowadays, and without proper internet protection, there is no doubt that you will be invaded by viruses, spyware, malware and more. The most basic of protection is anti-malware and firewalls. Anti-malware protects against many intruders such as viruses, Trojan horses, rootkits, spyware etc. There is many different types, with the most popular ones being Kaspersky, Norton, Avast and AVG. All of these practically do the same things, having a firewall, which is practically a sieve that sifts out all harmful things that try to reach your computer, and have computer searches that look through your computer like a search party, finding any malicious things that the firewall missed.
