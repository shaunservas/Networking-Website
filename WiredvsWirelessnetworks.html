  Wired internet can be significantly faster than wireless internet and there is no worry about having places where internet cannot be reached, like wireless networks, since it is directly connected to the network switch. Wireless can have dead spots where it is too far for it to reach or it cannot penetrate through certain walls, meaning that there can be trouble using internet in certain parts of the house if the router isnt placed right. Wired internet is good for desktops, as they are generally not used mobile, but laptops that are used for work, study or etcetera where you move frequently it is not advisable and not convenient. If the desktop is in a different room to the router, then a long Ethernet cable would need to be bought, and can be an nuisance.

Wireless internet is a lot more useful for family households with lots of mobile devices, as no wires are needed to connect several different items. The only problem with wireless networks is their security, connection difficulties and speeds. Wireless networks are a lot easier to attack then wired networks. Wireless networks can be picked up anywhere in the vicinity, and if it is not password protected, can be taken advantage of to use your internet or to implement viruses, spyware and more on the other systems on the network. The only way wired networks can be attacked is by someone having a wire connecting to the router. Wireless networks in a highly populated area such as in a city with close buildings or apartments can be using the same wireless frequency, meaning that they can interfere with each other, and if you do not know what you are doing and use an incorrect channel, it can cause unreliable connections or just no connection at all.

No matter what you choose, wireless or wired, you have to think about your context, surroundings and who is going to use the network. Having a large household with a wired network would be impractical, having wiring leading all around the house, so using a wireless network can be very effective, but being a single person with no mobile devices and a desktop, wireless connection is not utilising your maximum capabilities that a wired network could with faster transmission rates. Both ways have their pros and cons, it just depends on what you need.
