Now I know what you think, this looks pretty complicated. Actually it is pretty easy, the top of the diagram is an RTP cable that comes out of the telephone socket in a household. This RTP Cable leads into an RJ11 port in the modem. From then on the rest of the ports are RJ45 and the cables are cat6. The green represents wireless, meaning that devices can connect to the WAP wirelessly using 802.11n. If there is any words that you don't know in the diagram please refer to the components page. If there is any components that you have to buy, there is some reputable stores such as Dick Smith, JB HI-FI, and many more if you look online. Once you have it all setup like this then you have yourself a homenetwork.
